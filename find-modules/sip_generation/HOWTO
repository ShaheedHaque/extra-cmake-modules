Pre-requisites
==============


Ubuntu/Debian "sudo apt install"
--------------------------------

    python-clang-3.9 libclang-3.9       # For libclang
    sip-dev python-sip-dev              # For sip.h
    pyqt5-dev python-pyqt5              # For PyQt

    qtbase5-dev                         # For QtCore
    qttools5-dev                        # For kwidgetsaddons
    kdoctools-dev libkf5guiaddons-dev   # For kconfigwidgets
    qtdeclarative5-dev                  # For ki18n
    libqt5x11extras5-dev                # For kjobwidgets

To build PyKF5
==============

    #
    # 1. Run the SIP generation phase.
    #
    ./sip_bulk_generator.py sip
    #
    # 2. Run the compiler...
    #
    ./sip_compiler.py sip

The output is:

    # A "tmp" directory containing .sip files.
    # A "PyKF5" directory (set as the project name in rules_PyKF5.py) with:
        * The bindings comprising a __init__.py, and all the .so files
          such as KItemModels.so.
        * A disposable "tmp" directory

To build your own bindings
==========================

See the output of running the rules_engine.py as a main program:

    ./rules_engine.py

Run the sip_bulk_generator.py and the sip_compiler.py as above but with command 
line options overriding the defaults (which are intended for PyKF5 and similar 
frameworks). Optionally, use sip_generator.py if you want a more manual 
approach.

Each tool has online help accessed via the -h option.
